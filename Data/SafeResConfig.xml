	This file enables configuration of the Xanthos Safe Resurrection System module without code changes
	You may only change the values between the '>' and '<' characters to set the configuratoin
	parameters.  The type attribute is ignored and is only provided as a documentary guide to
	the user. Array element names are also meaningless.  Values may be left empty, with the
	exception of individual array elements, so that the value in the code is used.
	
	For example: to change the foo configuration from 50 to 100 one would change
		<foo type="int">50</foo>
			to
		<foo type="int">100</foo>

			These strings will be randomly selected when a player dies. Use of string
			substitution variables allows information about the death to be dynamically
			inserted into the string.
			
			The variables are defined as follows:
			{0} = victim		[the name of the player that died]
			{1} = he/she		[based on whether the victim is a he or a she]
			{2} = his/her		[based on whether the victim is a he or a she]
			{3} = killer		[the name of the player who killed the victim]
			{4} = deaths		[the number of times the player has died since shard startup]
